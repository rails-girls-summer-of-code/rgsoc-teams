Hey there!

This is a reminder to please update your team log - since your last entry was created more than 24 hours ago!
We require all teams of RGSoC to daily update their log (except weekends). Thank you.

If you are on national holidays that you've cleared with your supervisors,
please just ignore this and enjoy your day(s) off!

Cheers,
your friendly RGSoC-Teams-App Robot
